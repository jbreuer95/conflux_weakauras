# Conflux Weakauras

This is a long term project to provide a packing list and a consumable reminders for every class in conflux raids.

## Installation instructions
1. Download weakaura's if you don't have it already open it with the command /wa
2. In the topleft you can import a string. Paste the string from the .txt files of your class in this repository.

## Customize appearance
If you want to edit the position of your packinglist/reminders select the group and go to the group tab.
Then you can change the x and y offset for the position of the icons on your screen

If you want to edit the size of the icon select the group go to the display tab and change the width and the height values

## Edit icons (disable/change amount or shown days)
By default all the packlist items are enabled, since some of them are really expensive or cheaper variant or maybe not available to you like the Aqual Quintessence you can disable some of them.

Open the group (+ icon below the name) and find the item you want to disable. Go to the Custom Options tab (DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING IN THE OTHER TABS!) and deselect the active checkbox.

Here you can also change the amount you want to have with you or the day the reminder should be active. I dont recommend changing the days on an per item basis but doing this from the group. This is a bit bugged so if your not sure dont touch this, the default is Sunday.
